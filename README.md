# gfwlist2pac

## Installation

You must install @clowwindy's gfwlist2pac first, using this command

```
pip install gfwlist2pac
```
or
```
sudo easy_install gfwlist2pac
```
You now could configure your GoAgentX to use this custom PAC instead. Now we could stop complaining that @ohdarling88 drops the gfwlist supports in his GoAgentX version2

Enjoy it.

Thanks to @ohdarling88, @clowwindy

More works need to do

add user rule supports for multiple proxies (such as u2b should go through GAE instead of shadowsocks)# gfwlist2pac
